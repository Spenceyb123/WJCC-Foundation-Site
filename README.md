# WJCC-Foundation-Site
Built to complete internship course for SLCC Web Dev and Design Certificate.
I was paired with one other student over the course of about 5 weeks to complete the website to the specifications of Tim Johnson, who is one of the board members for the West Jordan Chamber of Commerce Foundation.
This site was built mostly using Bootstrap Studio, and was my first experience using Bootstrap Studio.
